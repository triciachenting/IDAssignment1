                <p>I am a dedicated person who tries my best in my work and always trying to cope with the tasks that i am given.
                    As a wise man once said "I don't live to work; I work to live."
                    I believe in work life balance where rest is equally, if not, more important as my work.
                    Family will always be important to me as we rely on each other for many things in life,
                    they are our main pillar of support for as long as we live.
                    My wish one day would be to retire and live peacefully on a countryside where I would have a farm with my friends, 
                    namely Imzumi and Keerthana.
