What is the website catering for?
Attribute all external source code used

The user of this website is looking at a portfolio of a potential client.
The user wishes to know more about the client before deciding whether to partner or not.
The user might also be looking for the link to contact the client and may also alert the client 
of their interest in working with them by dropping their own contact.
This website caters for companies who are trying to hire an employee 
or for people who would like to get to know the person featured on the portfolio. 
This website allows users to know more about the client in the shortest amount of time as the website 
is short, simple and easy to navigate around.
The website provides information that would be included in a resume in a website format which makes it 
convenient and easy to organise the data for the user.


Having many pages to the website, the user is able to navigate around easily without having 
to scroll through much to find the information that they are looking for.
The user is looking at a different way which a resume is being formed. It may be unconventional 
but it adds personality to the person whose portfolio they are viewing.
The user is also able to know how the person's work attitude might be like from the information shared.
If I were a user myself, I would want a potential client to surprise me in a good way and 
having a website to do that shows the lengths the client would be willing to go if we were to partner.


Webpage 1 - allows the user to know how the potential client will look like and a few fun facts 
about her so the user can start to warm up to her.
Webpage 2 - information about the potential client and what she believes in and another photo of her
Webpage 3 - preious and current institutions that the potential client is or has been in
Webpage 4 - hard skills(what she is competent in), soft skills(her people skills and 
how she might communicate with others), academic interests(her educational goal in mind and thinking), 
hobbies(what she would do in her free time outside of work)
Webpage 5 - way to contact her and for her to contact you


Feature to implement could be other achievements and work that she has done.
