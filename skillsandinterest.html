                From my list of skills, it is evident that I am a person who is willing to
                learn new things and take charge when needed. My MBTI report states that I am an ENFP-T.
                As an ENFP-T I am a charming, independent, energetic and compassionate person.
                According to my kuder report, I am a social, enterprising
                and artistic being. I also have a curious mind, always craving to learn more.

                    The career path I want to pursue is being Solutions Architect.
                    I will definitely start off far from my goal but I will work towards what I want to do.
                    My ideal path would be to further my education at NTU taking up Computer Science as they 
                    offer modules that I feel would be interesting and would benefit my learning.

                   My Hobbies include Volleyball, spending quality family, cooking and also singing 
                   while everybody is asleep so no one would be able to hear or judge me. I also enjoy relaxing 
                   and watching Netflix during my free time at home. I personally feel that watching movies or dramas 
                   are not the just enjoyable, we are also able to learn much more from just watching as these 
                   films often teach life lessons. I do watch Chinese dramas from which I do pick up new words from 
                   and it has helped maintain my Mandarin speaking abilities which I am sure would be useful in the future.
