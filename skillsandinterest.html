                    The career path I want to pursue is being Solutions Architect.
                    I will definitely start off far from my goal but I will work towards what I want to do.
                    My ideal path would be to further my education at NTU taking up Computer Science as they 
                    offer modules that I feel would be interesting and would benefit my learning.
